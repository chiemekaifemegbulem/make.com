# 🛒 E-commerce Automation: From Manual to Fully Automated (Make.com Scenario)

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains a **Make.com (formerly Integromat)** scenario that takes a client’s e-commerce process from **manual chaos** to **seamless, end-to-end automation**.

If you’re running an online store, you know how much time gets wasted on repetitive tasks like manually updating inventory, copying order details into shipping software, and sending follow-up emails to customers.  

This scenario solves all of that — **freeing up your time and eliminating costly mistakes**.

The automation is designed to connect **e-commerce platforms** (Shopify, WooCommerce, or others) with payment gateways, fulfillment services, and CRM tools.

**High-level steps:**

1. **Trigger: New Order**
   - The scenario starts whenever a new order is placed on the store.
   - Platforms supported: Shopify, WooCommerce, Etsy, or custom API integrations.

2. **Order Data Extraction**
   - Automatically fetches complete order details: customer name, email, shipping address, items purchased, and payment status.

3. **Inventory Update**
   - Updates inventory counts in real time to prevent overselling.
   - Can sync with ERP or inventory management software.

4. **Payment Confirmation**
   - Verifies that payment has been received.
   - Supports PayPal, Stripe, or direct bank API confirmations.

5. **Fulfillment Request**
   - Sends order details to the warehouse, dropshipping supplier, or shipping API.
   - Can automatically generate and attach shipping labels.

6. **Customer Notification**
   - Sends a branded order confirmation email/SMS to the customer.
   - Updates them with shipping tracking info once the package is dispatched.

7. **CRM Entry**
   - Logs the customer and order into the client’s CRM for future marketing or loyalty programs.

8. **Error Handling**
   - Sends an alert to the store manager in case of failed payment, out-of-stock product, or API failure.
